        <h3>Subject: Eileen Dover university application</h3>
        <p>Dear Eillen,</p>
        <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year.
             I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
        <h4>Starting dates</h4>
        <p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning
             of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
            <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
            <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
        <p>You can find more information about <a href="#">important university dates</a></p>
        <h4>Subjects of study</h4>
        <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility &mdash; as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of 
            science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of persone
            we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol(C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at tempratures exceeding 30&deg;C (86&deg;F), when the audience size exponentially 
                increases (effects of 3 x 10<sup>3</sup>&gt; 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>)</li>
            <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representnig musical scores.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the research to take, required staff and 
            other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>
        <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
